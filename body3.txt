Hi {FirstName},

I just recently left you a VM and wanted to follow up again via VM. Let me know if it's not the right time. The mission critical PM and Superintendent candidates I shared are still available. 

I reattached their profiles in case it is easier to review when you have time. If these are not the exact fit and you are looking for something more specific, feel free to let me know. With our work on STARGATE, we stay close to this market and can usually match project type, technical scope, and availability quickly.
