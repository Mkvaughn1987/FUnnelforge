Hi {FirstName},{FirstName}

I wanted to follow up briefly.

As mentioned, my team at ARENA is running recruitment for the STARGATE Project in Abilene, TX, and maintaining a strong pipeline of mission critical PMs and Superintendents who have supported large scale data center, high voltage, heavy MEP, and civil infrastructure programs. I have attached 3 of them for your review. 

Do you typically handle staffing for roles like this at {Company}, or is there someone else I should connect with? I reattached the profiles again for convenience.
