Hi {FirstName},

I wanted to close the loop so I am not filling your inbox. I assume your team is all set and doesn't need any external help. 

If priorities shift, my team at ARENA will continue supporting mission critical hiring and maintain a strong pipeline of PMs, Superintendents, and technical field leaders who have delivered data center, industrial, high voltage, semiconductor, and large civil programs across the U.S.

Also, If you are ever on the market, feel free to reach out to me as well. I focus in exec level recruitment. 

I will stay in touch periodically and share relevant candidates when it makes sense. Thank you for the time either way.
