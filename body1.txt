Hi {FirstName},

I will keep this quick.

My team at Arena Recruiting is running recruitment for the STARGATE Project in Abilene, TX, and we have built a strong pipeline of mission critical PMs and Superintendents tied to hyperscale data centers, high voltage power distribution, heavy MEP scopes, and large civil infrastructure programs. I wanted to share a group of candidates I have in my pipeline that would be a good fit. 

All 3 well versed in data center ground up builds.  All profiles are lightly redacted and attached. If any are worth a conversation, I am happy to walk you through them or connect with the right person on your team.
